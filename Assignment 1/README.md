# Assignment 1 – Basic Python Programs

This assignment contains two simple Python programs that practice:

- Taking input from the user
- Performing basic arithmetic operations
- Working with strings and formatted output   

---

## Files Included

- `tuteDA1Q1.py` – Arithmetic operations on two numbers  
- `tuteDA1Q2.py` – Greeting the user using their first and last name  

---

## 1. `tuteDA1Q1.py` – Basic Arithmetic Calculator

This program:

- Asks the user to enter **two integers**
- Performs the following operations on them:
  - Addition  
  - Subtraction  
  - Multiplication  
  - Division  
- Prints each result with a label in a clear format :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

### How It Works

1. The program uses `input()` to read two numbers from the user.
2. Converts them to integers using `int()`.
3. Performs `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operations.
4. Displays the results using formatted print statements (`f-strings`).

### Example Usage

```text
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 10

Addition: 15
Subtraction: -5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 0.5
